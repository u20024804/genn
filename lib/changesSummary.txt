(user side) Changes in this large revision:

- Users are now required to call "initGeNN()" before adding any
  populations. Ideally we could also force them to do so before
  changing any of the nModels etc queues - maybe we should make a few
  wrappers instead of letting users push_back on those queues without
  control.

- glbscnt is now call glbSpkCnt for consistency

- There is no longer a privileged parameter "Epre" - spike type events
  are now defined by a code string - spkEvntThreshold.

- The function setSynapseG is deprecated. In a GLOBALG scenario, the
  variables of a synapse group are fixed to the initial values
  provided in modeldefinition.

- Due to the split of synaptic models into weightUpdateModel and
  postSynModel, the parameter arrays used during model definition need
  to be carefully split as well so that each side gets the right
  parameters.

- users can now define variables as type "scalar" which will at code
  generation be translated to the model's ftype (typically float or
  double).

(developer side)
- I have changed the allocateSparseArrays to take the connN as an
argument. (Sorry, the previous way of first setting it and the using
the function was just too awkward for me).

- There is some placeholder code that uses (so far non-initialised)
  reverse lookup arrays for the post-to pre mapping in sparse
  arrays. I am assuming the existence of a "remap" array that
  indicates the positions of relevant entries in the value arrays.

- There is definitely some confusion with the delays now. I think I
  would like to discuss this further and see whether we can do
  something more systematic

- In the long run I would like to get rid of SpkEvnt code whenever it
  is not actually used. This should not be a problem other than that
  at the moment delay queues generally depend on SpkEvnt ... need to
  have a choice of queues for either SpkEvnt or Spk.

- I would like to introduce some rule checking about the allowed
  combinations of ALLTOALL DENSE and SPARSE, with INDIVIDUALG,
  INDIVIDUALID, GLOBALG. This could happen at each
  adSynapsPopulation.
